changes:
  - spellcheck: Fixes some variable typos for get_process_efficiency
  - tweak: Changes the heart's blood volume equation to an identical one that is easier
      to look at.
  - tweak: Changes the get_tally() function to include nerve and muscle efficiency.
      Only thing changed between this equation and the old equation is a .25 modifier
      on muscle efficiency. So minor it won't be noticed. (it still doesn't do much)
  - bugfix: Changed the take_damage function to account for bone efficiency when deciding
      whether or not to fracture a bone, like it does when an organ takes internal
      damage. This makes reinforced bones function better.
