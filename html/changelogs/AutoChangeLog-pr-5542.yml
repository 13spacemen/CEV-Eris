changes:
  - tweak: Tool spawners will no longer spawn items with the "junk" tag. Added junk
      tag to all improvised tools.
  - balance: Adjusted various rarity values on tools, and removed reinforced plating's
      lower rarity value.
  - bugfix: Tool spawner will no longer spawn only from a list of duct tape. Circular
      saws will no longer dominate places where surgical tools randomly spawn.
