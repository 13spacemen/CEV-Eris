changes:
  - tweak: Low walls (without a window) and unflipped tables will no longer block
      "living", "hard-stunned" creatures, meaning that, without any shielding, you
      can now break a window to space and get spaced if you don't have magboots.
  - balance: Airflow stun length has been nerfed from 5 to 3 ticks, so that you don't
      get back up from the stun in the middle of nowhere after getting spaced.
