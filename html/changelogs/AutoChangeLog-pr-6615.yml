changes:
  - balance: Adjusts drill delays, makes the onestar/hive/roach bosses unable to be
      dragged
  - bugfix: Fixes mechs drilling/clamping stuff from afar and getting stuck randomly.
  - soundadd: Adds a new sound for mech punches, uses a different sound for mech clamps/drills
  - code_imp: Ports Occulus-Eris's mech gear range check and hopefully fixes mechs
      getting stuck on nothing.
