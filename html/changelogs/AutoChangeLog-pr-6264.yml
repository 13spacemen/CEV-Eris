changes:
  - rscadd: added the dominion and counselor to the EOTP spawn pool.
  - tweak: The explosive disk was removed from the NT grenade pack. It was moved into
      its own grenade pack, with a limit of two grenades.
  - tweak: tweaked the EOTP disks. The crusader and voidsuit disk were merged together
      into the armor and voidsuit disk, and all melee disks and the shield disk from
      the EOTP were merged into the advanced melee disk.
  - balance: nerfed the crusader armor's melee and bomb armor slightly, decreased
      its slowdown, and nerfed NT shield slightly.
