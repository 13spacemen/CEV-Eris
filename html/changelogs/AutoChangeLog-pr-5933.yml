changes:
  - tweak: Max scrubber flow rate is now 400 Liters per second
  - tweak: vents and scrubbers now have a power rating of 12000 watts instead of 7500,
      this should make them able to move more moles of gas
  - tweak: scrubbers and vents now have more volume
  - tweak: APCs and air alarms (hopefully) no longer take fire damage and break, NT
      has now upgraded them
