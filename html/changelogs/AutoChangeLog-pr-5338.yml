changes:
  - rscadd: Two new mech propulsion parts, ported from bay, not related to any premade
      models - feel free to use them in your custom mechs!
  - rscadd: Two new variables on mech parts, ported from bay, turn_delay and climb_time.
      They affect time to turn the mech and time to climb into it respectively. Notably,
      the light chassis now takes less time to enter, while the heavy chassis takes
      more.
  - tweak: Exosuit nodes on robotics research tree moved around to make more sense.
  - balance: Many mech parts have had their stats and costs altered.
  - code_imp: changed some paths for mech parts
