changes:
  - tweak: Recipe for crossbow bolts moved to guns section, right under powered crossbow.
  - tweak: Crossbow recipe edited slightly to include glass, representing a poor scope.
  - tweak: Crossbow has a minor zoom factor now, 3 spaces when used.
  - tweak: Bolts now embed on hit and can be extracted from kills in bolt form to
      be used again. Prior to this they turned into metal rods on hits.
  - tweak: Embedded bolts are sharp, dealing pain, brute and toxin like normal shrapnel
      if you run without removing them. They can be removed via surgery or right clicking
      to yank.
  - tweak: Recipe for bolts costs the same, but you now spend 5 metal rods to make
      a handful of 5 bolts rather than 5 individual bolts, less clicks on players
      side.
  - tweak: You now get chat messages telling you when you load or unload a bolt to/from
      the crossbow.
  - tweak: Remaining bolt stack sprite properly updates when loading the crossbow
      with a single one.
  - tweak: You now only unload a bolt from the crossbow if you interact with an empty
      hand on a loaded crossbow you are currently holding.
  - balance: Energy use of powered crossbow was made more efficient, 50 instead of
      100.
  - balance: Fire Delay of powered crossbow was lowered, 6 instead of 12.
  - balance: Projectile damage of powered crossbow was buffed, 40 -> 55.
  - balance: Projectile penetration of powered crossbow was buffed 20 -> 30.
  - imageadd: Bolt projectile sprite was changed to something more fitting
